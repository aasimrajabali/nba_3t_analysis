NBA 3-Pointer Analysis
======================

Description

It's no secret that NBA players are always looking for ways to optimize their game, and one change rapidly taking place is the amount of 3-pointers being shot. A data analysis on how the 3-Pointer is changing the NBA over time.

But how exactly has the 3-pointer evolved over time and changed the NBA? What certain positions or stats does it potentially impact? In this analysis, we will explore how the NBA has changed along with the evolution of the 3-pointer.

After reading the [article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/r/how-has-the-three-point-line-changed-the-nba-and-the-game-of-basketball/) by Archie Meng, I was inspired to create this project and explore the evolution of the 3-point shot in different ways.
